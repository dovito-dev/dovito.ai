You are helping me document the visual and verbal brand system for this project.
Scan all files in this Replit project (including src/, public/, assets/, styles/, components/, and config files) and extract only the brand kit into a single Markdown file named BRAND_KIT.md in the project root.​

Goals

Identify and document every brand element that appears in the codebase, design assets, or config files.

Produce a clear, human-readable brand kit that can be used by designers and developers to keep future work on-brand.​

Scope of extraction

From CSS, Tailwind config, design tokens, theme files, SVGs, images, and copy, extract and document:

Brand overview

Brand name, tagline, mission or value statements if present.

One-sentence description of the brand’s tone and personality inferred from copy and UI text.

Logo and marks

File paths and names of logo files and icons (SVG, PNG, etc.).

Variants (full logo, wordmark, icon-only, light/dark versions) and any usage notes you can infer.

Colors

List all color tokens, variables, and hard-coded colors that appear to be part of the design system.

For each color: name/key, HEX (and RGBA/HSL if available), and its role (primary, secondary, accent, background, text, semantic states like success/error/warning/info).

Group them into logical palettes (e.g., primary, secondary, neutrals, semantic).

Typography

All font families (including fallbacks) used in the project.

For each family: roles (headings, body, monospace, UI), typical sizes, weights, and line-heights when available.

Heading hierarchy: typical styles for 
h
1
h1–
h
6
h6 and main body text styles.

Spacing & layout tokens

Any spacing, radius, and shadow tokens or utility scales (e.g., spacing, borderRadius, shadows in design token files or Tailwind config).

Summarize the core scale (e.g., small, medium, large, etc.) and how it is used in components.

Components & patterns

Key reusable UI components that have strong brand identity (e.g., buttons, cards, nav bars, badges, modals).

For each, describe: typical colors, typography, corner radius, shadows, and any notable interaction states (hover, focus, active, disabled).

Call out any layout patterns that recur (hero sections, cards grid, forms, etc.).

Imagery & illustration style

Any systematic guidance you can infer about imagery: photo vs illustration, color grading, icon style, shape language, etc.

Example asset paths that best represent the intended style.

Tone of voice & content

Extract key examples of UI copy, headings, CTAs, and helper text that illustrate tone.

Summarize tone of voice in 3–5 bullets (e.g., friendly, concise, playful, formal).

Constraints

Do not modify existing source files except to add the new BRAND_KIT.md.

Do not include non-brand technical details such as API endpoints, business logic, or database schemas.

If something is ambiguous, make a best-effort inference and clearly label it as an inference.

Ensure the brand kit is complete and includes every brand-related token or rule you can find.
