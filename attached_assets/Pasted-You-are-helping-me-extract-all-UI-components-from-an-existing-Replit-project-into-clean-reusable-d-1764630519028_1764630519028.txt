You are helping me extract all UI components from an existing Replit project into clean, reusable, documented components that follow a component-library style similar to shadcn/ui and Radix-based systems used in modern React/Tailwind design systems.​​​

Extraction target:
Scope name: Brand Kit
Target scope: Extract the entire UI for the current page identified by Brand Kit, including all components and subcomponents rendered on that page.​

High-level goals:
Extract only the code, styles, and data model required for all components on Brand Kit and the page-level shell that directly wraps them.​
Produce a single markdown file as output, containing:

A human-readable specification and documentation for the page and each component.

The complete, ready-to-use component code for the page component and all of its child components.

All required styles, tokens, and dependencies.​
The result must be plug-and-play in a new project with zero unrelated site context.​

Scope and isolation rules:
Include ONLY:

HTML/JSX/TSX and logic directly used by the Brand Kit page component and all components rendered within it.

All internal elements of those components: text, icons, buttons, images, links, badges, overlays, animations, hover/tap effects, and layout wrappers that belong to the page and its child components.​

Any data structures (interfaces/types, arrays, configuration objects) used to render the Brand Kit page and its components.​

EXCLUDE COMPLETELY:

Other pages, routes, or layouts not used by Brand Kit.​

Global site-level typography, layout, reset styles, or scripts that are only used outside Brand Kit.​

Any framework boilerplate or routing code not needed to render the Brand Kit page itself and its components.​

Component and page structure and documentation:
Create a markdown file named brand-kit-extraction.md with the following sections (use markdown headings and code fences):

TITLE
“Brand Kit Page Extraction”

Component Overview

Briefly describe what the Brand Kit page does and where it appears in the original project.

Mention key behaviors: interactions, animations, hover/tap effects, responsive behavior.​

List the main components present on the page (for example: HeroSection, FeatureGrid, PricingTable, FooterCta, etc.) with a one-line description for each.

Component Structure
Provide a bullet list describing the full element and component hierarchy for the Brand Kit page.​

Start from the page-level root component (for example Brand Kit Page or similar).

For each direct child section/component, describe its purpose and its main internal parts.

Within each main component, outline:

Root Container – high-level wrapper for the component.

Row/Column/Grid wrappers – layout structure.

Card/Item – clickable or interactive units.

Content wrappers – alignment and spacing.

Text elements – titles, subtitles, labels.

Badges, icons, overlays – status and visual emphasis.​
Keep this at the level of UI/component architecture rather than global layout.​

Dependencies Required
List all libraries and frameworks that the Brand Kit page and its components depend on (for example React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, framer-motion, lucide-react, shadcn/ui, or others actually used in the page).​
For each dependency include:

Name

Purpose (1 short sentence)

Exact installation commands (e.g., npm or pnpm) needed for this page and its components only.​

CSS Custom Properties and Design Tokens
Extract ONLY the CSS custom properties, design tokens, and theme variables directly referenced by any component on the Brand Kit page.​
For example:

Color tokens (background, foreground, primary, border, muted, etc.).

Shadows, radius, spacing, and any component-specific variables.​
Present them as:

A short code block with the minimal required :root or component-scope variables.

A short bullet/markdown table explaining what each token is used for (e.g., primary color for live items, muted color for secondary state).​

Styles and Classes Reference
Extract all selectors, classes, and style rules used by the Brand Kit page and all of its descendant components:​

Tailwind utility classes, custom class names, or scoped CSS selectors.

Animation-related classes, transitions, hover/focus/tap state rules, responsive rules (e.g., sm/md/lg breakpoints).

Organize these into small subsections, for example:

Layout wrappers (page-level containers, section wrappers)

Main components/sections (e.g., hero, grids, lists, forms)

Content (titles, subtitles, descriptions, supporting text)

Status badges, icons, overlays

Forms and interactive inputs

Empty/placeholder states (if any)​

For each group, provide a compact markdown table:

Element

Classes/selectors

Brief purpose/use.​

Animation and Interaction Specifications
Document all animations and interactions used anywhere on the Brand Kit page:​

Initial/entry animations (e.g., opacity, scale, position).

Hover, focus, and tap/click effects.

Motion/animation libraries usage (e.g., framer-motion props).

For each animation, specify:

Target element(s) or component(s).

Properties animated (e.g., scale, opacity, translate, box-shadow).

Timing (duration, delay, easing, spring stiffness, etc.).​
Represent this as concise code blocks plus a short table summarizing key parameters.​

Data Model and Props
Define TypeScript interfaces/types for any data objects used by the Brand Kit page and its components (for example items/cards with id, name, status, url, position, etc.).​
Define:

A props interface for the exported Brand Kit page component (if it accepts props).

Props interfaces for each exported child component on the page (for example HeroSectionProps, FeatureGridProps, etc.).

Add a small markdown table describing each prop for every exported component:

Name

Type

Default (if any)

Description.​

Complete Component Code
Provide full, self-contained React/TypeScript (TSX) implementations for:

The main Brand Kit page component.

All reusable child components used on that page (for example HeroSection, FeatureCard, PricingPlan, TestimonialCard, etc.).

The code must:

Import only the dependencies listed in “Dependencies Required”.

Assume the design tokens and CSS utilities documented earlier.

Not depend on other pages, global layout shells, or unrelated sections.

The code should:

Use the documented data model and props.

Implement all interactions, animations, and visual states extracted from the original page.

Handle empty or missing data gracefully (e.g., optional sections, empty arrays).​
Ensure the page and its components are ready to be dropped into a new React/Tailwind project.​

Usage Example
Provide a minimal TSX usage snippet showing how to:

Import the Brand Kit page component.

Optionally define sample data/props (if required).

Render the Brand Kit page inside a simple app-level container (for example within an App component).​
The example should be self-contained and easy to paste into a new project.​

Design Notes and Behavior
Briefly describe:

Visual style (e.g., glass-morphism, color states for different statuses, hover glow, etc.) as actually used on Brand Kit and its components.​

Responsive behavior (how the page and its sections adapt across breakpoints; for example, grid columns changing between mobile and desktop, stacking vs side-by-side layouts).​

Any important accessibility considerations if visible in the code (aria labels, keyboard focus, semantic landmarks like <main>, <section>, etc.).​

Scope and IDs/Classes Summary
List all class names, IDs, and data attributes that belong to the Brand Kit page and its components.​
Make it explicit that these are the only selectors the consumer should rely on.​
Confirm that no unrelated navbar/page/footer from other pages or global site shell selectors are included.​

License & Upstream Source
Add a section that clearly states:

Whether the Brand Kit page and its components are original or adapted/derived from another source (for example shadcn/ui, Radix UI, Dovito, or other libraries/templates).

The license used for this page and its components (for example MIT, Apache-2.0, or a custom license) and any required attribution or notices that must accompany reuse.​

Changelog
Add a brief changelog for Brand Kit including:

Initial extraction date and version (for example v1.0.0 – initial extraction from Replit project).

Subsequent entries for meaningful changes such as API updates, styling changes, dependency updates, or behavior changes.​

Constraints and cleanup:

Do NOT include any code, CSS, or JS that is only used by other pages or components of the site not rendered on Brand Kit.​

Do NOT include global layout wrappers, base resets, navbars, or footers that are not part of the Brand Kit page itself. If the page has its own header/footer that are specific to this page, you may include them as components.​

Keep the markdown organized, concise, and focused on making Brand Kit and all of its components reusable in a design system style.​

Finally, generate and return the complete brand-kit-extraction.md content as the answer.
